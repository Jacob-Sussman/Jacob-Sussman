## ðŸ“˜ About Me
Hello! My name is Jacob Sussman and I am a senior at Marquette University studying computer science. In my free time, I enjoy coding and exploring new technologies. I am also an avid guitar player and enjoy staying active through exercise. In addition to my studies, I am the founder of BitByBite, a software development firm focused on using artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn as a developer.
